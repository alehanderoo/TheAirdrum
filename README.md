# TheAirdrum
Repository for The Airdrum project. 

The Airdrum is a musical instrument that can be played by moving objects above the panels. These panels contain IR-distance sensors and colored LEDs. The Airdrum is designed by two Dutch engineering students and is originally intended to be played by people with multiple severe disabilities during a 
musical therapy session to have better interaction between therapist and end-user.
